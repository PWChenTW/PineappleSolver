# Pineapple OFC Enhanced Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the Pineapple OFC Solver with joker support, street-by-street solving, and a graphical user interface.

## 2. Core Requirements

### 2.1 Joker Card System
- **Requirement**: Add 2 joker cards to the standard 52-card deck
- **Functionality**: 
  - Jokers can substitute for any card to form the best possible hand
  - Evaluation algorithm must find optimal joker substitution
  - Special display indicators for joker cards in GUI
- **Priority**: High

### 2.2 Random Initial Hand
- **Requirement**: Initial 5 cards should be randomly dealt from shuffled deck
- **Functionality**:
  - Shuffle full 54-card deck (including jokers)
  - Deal 5 cards to player
  - Support re-deal functionality
- **Priority**: High

### 2.3 Performance Enhancement
- **Requirement**: Support 100,000 MCTS simulations
- **Functionality**:
  - Optimize algorithm for large-scale simulations
  - Implement parallel computing
  - Smart pruning strategies
  - Result caching mechanism
- **Priority**: High

### 2.4 Street-by-Street Solving
- **Requirement**: Solve each street independently
- **Functionality**:
  - After initial 5 cards, deal 3 cards per street
  - Player places 2 cards and discards 1
  - Track opponent's placed cards (simplified)
  - Update available deck after each street
- **Priority**: High

### 2.5 Opponent Simulation
- **Requirement**: Simple opponent tracking
- **Functionality**:
  - Randomly place 5 cards for opponent after street 1
  - Randomly place 2 cards for opponent after each subsequent street
  - Remove opponent's cards from available deck
  - No need for intelligent opponent play
- **Priority**: High

### 2.6 Graphical User Interface
- **Requirement**: Streamlit-based clickable interface
- **Functionality**:
  - Visual card table representation
  - Click-to-select card dealing
  - Drag-and-drop or click placement
  - Real-time MCTS suggestions
  - Statistics dashboard
  - Save/load game state
- **Priority**: High

## 3. Additional Requirements

### 3.1 Game State Management
- Save/load game progress
- Undo/redo functionality
- Game replay feature
- Export game history

### 3.2 Statistics and Analysis
- Win probability calculation
- Expected score display
- Decision tree visualization
- Performance metrics
- Historical analysis

### 3.3 User Experience

- Tutorial mode
- Tooltips and help system
- Multi-language support (English/Chinese)

### 3.4 Technical Requirements
- Response time < 5 seconds for 100k simulations
- Memory usage < 2GB
- Cross-platform compatibility
