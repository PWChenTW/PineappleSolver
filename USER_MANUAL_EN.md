## Game Rules

### Pineapple OFC Basic Rules

#### Game Objective
Arrange 13 cards into three hands and score points by comparing each hand against your opponent's.

#### Hand Structure
- **Front Hand**: 3 cards - Top row
- **Middle Hand**: 5 cards - Middle row

#### Critical Rule
**Hand strength must follow: Back ‚â• Middle ‚â• Front** (Violation results in fouling)

#### Dealing Process
1. **Initial Phase**: Deal 5 cards, all must be placed
2. **Subsequent Rounds**: Deal 3 cards each round, place 2, discard 1
3. **Total 5 Rounds**: Each player places 13 cards total

### Scoring System

- Win each hand individually for 1 point
- Win all three hands (scoop) for 3 bonus points (6 total)
- Fouling loses all hands plus penalty points

## Strategy Guide

### Beginner Tips

#### 1. Basic Principles
- **Safety First**: Better conservative than fouling
- **Balanced Development**: Don't over-strengthen one hand
- **Keep Flexibility**: Maintain options early

#### 2. Common Patterns
- **Pair Distribution**: Small pairs front, big pairs middle
- **Connected Cards**: Preserve straight and flush possibilities
- **High Cards**: A, K preferably in back hand

#### 3. Risk Management
- Avoid too-strong front hand leading to foul
- Don't lock weak hands in middle too early
- Leave room for later adjustments

### Advanced Techniques

#### 1. Expected Value Thinking
- Calculate long-term value of each decision
- Consider remaining card distribution probabilities
- Balance immediate gains with future potential

#### 2. Opponent Adaptation
- Observe opponent's placement habits
- Play more aggressively against conservative opponents
- Play solidly against aggressive opponents

#### 3. Key Decision Points
- **Initial 5 cards**: Determines entire game framework
- **Cards 10-11**: Last adjustment opportunities
- **Discard choices**: Affects opponent's available cards

#### 4. Fantasy Land Strategy
- Actively pursue QQ+ in front
- Plan hand types after entering
- Balance staying conditions

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

#### 1. Over-pursuing Royalties
- **Wrong**: Ignoring foul risk for high-scoring hands
- **Right**: Ensure no fouling first, then consider royalties

#### 2. Ignoring Hand Gradient
- **Wrong**: Focus only on single hand strength
- **Right**: Maintain Back ‚â• Middle ‚â• Front

#### 3. Giving Up Too Early
- **Wrong**: Random placement after bad start
- **Right**: Optimize every decision

#### 4. Rigid Thinking
- **Wrong**: Fixed patterns for all situations
- **Right**: Adapt flexibly to specific cards

#### 5. Poor Time Management
- **Wrong**: Overthinking simple decisions
- **Right**: More time on key decisions, quick on simple ones
